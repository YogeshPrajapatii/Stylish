Stylish is a modern, full-stack e-commerce application being built to master the entire lifecycle of a native Android app, from a beautiful client interface to a robust backend.

## Project Vision

The goal of this project is to create a complete, end-to-end shopping experience. It's my primary project for learning how to build a scalable, feature-rich Android application that communicates with a live backend, handles user authentication, and manages complex state.

- [x] User Authentication (Sign Up & Login)
- [ ] Password Reset / Forgot Password functionality
